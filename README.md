# Mortality Rate Analysis in Northern India

## Overview
This project analyzes mortality data from hospitals in Northern India to uncover trends in crude death rates across genders and states. By using **K-Means clustering** and **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**, we segmented districts with similar mortality patterns and identified high-risk areas that require healthcare interventions.

## Features:
- **Data Collection:** Mortality data from various districts in Northern India.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Grouped districts based on mortality patterns across genders.
- **ANN Classification:** Classified high-risk districts based on crude death rates.
- **Visual Insights:** Plots to help visualize gender disparities and state-level mortality differences.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Scikit-learn** for K-Means clustering.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for ANN classification.
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization.

## Results:
The analysis revealed higher mortality rates in males in certain states, such as Odisha and Uttar Pradesh. Clustering showed distinct patterns, allowing for targeted healthcare interventions in high-risk areas.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `final.py` script to generate the analysis and visualizations.

## Future Improvements:
- Include more socio-economic and healthcare access data for deeper analysis.
- Apply dimensionality reduction techniques for enhanced visualization.
